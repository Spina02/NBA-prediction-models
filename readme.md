# NBA Match & Man-of-the-Match Prediction (WIP)

This project explores machine learning approaches to **predict NBA game outcomes** and identify the **most impactful player in each match (Man of the Match)** using play‑by‑play and box‑score data.

The current focus is on:
- Building **leakage‑free, time‑aware features** (rolling team stats, rest days, pace, PER/Game Score–based impact metrics).
- Preparing clean tabular datasets suitable for **ensemble models** (e.g. Random Forest, XGBoost) and **walk‑forward validation**.

> **Status:** Work in progress – data preprocessing and feature engineering are in place; model selection, evaluation, and analysis are under active development.
